# General Overview
So you know, I don't think I used el-get correctly, though MELPA works fine-ish for me.

# Installation
This was created for a custom-built GNU Emacs 24.5. But I'm fairly sure that this will work fine on GNU Emacs 24.4.

Note: It will also work on 24.3, but electric-pair-mode is apparently less usable.

Just install GNU Emacs and replace your .emacs.d with this repository. Or at least, that's how it should work.
